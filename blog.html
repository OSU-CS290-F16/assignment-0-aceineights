<h2>Assignment 0, 9/25/2016</h2>
  <p>This assignment was a little tricky for me as I had no prior experiance with html. The hardest part was simply getting started,
  being used to using compilers, knowing where to write the code was a seemingly impossible problem. I think I spent 30+ minutes looking
  before realising that you just write a new file and push it to the web. While i had planned to use flickr as a medium to upload my photo,
  because a little suddle butt-kissing never hurt anyone, i didnt have a yahoo email and did not feel like making one. Which in turn
  lead me to use a website called postimage.org, and that seemed to work just fine. </p>
